This time, she needs your help to analyze some of her survey data. As part of Amelia's dietary study, participants are also asked to follow a special nutrition plan, the Dr. Amelia Recommended Nutrition Plan (the DARN Plan). We'll use a simple [perceptron](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#perceptron) to predict if participants follow the DARN Plan. \n",

    "As a note, this exercise lies somewhere between coding everything from scratch and relying on the pre-coded APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that underlie the power of TensorFlow, Keras, and Pytorch. **You will not need to create weight tensors beyond this exercise**. Still, hopefully, by doing it this time, you will have a better understanding (*and appreciation*) of the details often lost in an API call to `model.fit()`, for example.\n",

She is looking at how different factors predict if participants follow her DARN Plan ($y$, the output or [labels](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label) in our example) based on three input variables: if participants submit photos of three meals a day ($x_1$), if participants report being satisfied with their food choices ($x_2$), and if participants report being generally happy ($x_3$). We will combine $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ into our input tensor $X$. Here, we are simplifying the question of the likelihood of following the DARN Plan to a Yes/No. \n",
